    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate developer with a love for clean code and creative ideas. I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly solutions. My journey started with curiosity and grew into a career that feels like storytelling with technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve contributed to impactful projects, collaborated with diverse teams, and constantly strive to learn more. From frontend design to backend logic, I see code as a way to connect people and possibilities.

      Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, sipping tea, and exploring new cultures. I believe creativity fuels innovation, and every line of code can tell a story.Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, sipping tea, and exploring new cultures.
